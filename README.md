# Sparnatural - A natural way of building SPARQL queries

Sparnatural is a **visual SPARQL query builder written in javascript**.

It supports the creation of basic graph patterns with the selection of values with autocomplete search or dropdown lists. It can be configured through a JSON-LD ontology file that defines the classes and properties to be presented in the component.

You can play with an **online demo at http://labs.sparna.fr/sparnatural-demo-dbpedia/**.

# Getting Started

To get started :

1. Read the following documentation;
2. Look at how things work in file `sparnatural-demo-dbpedia/index.html`; 
   1. **Attention** : make sure you open this open through a web server, e.g. http://localhost/sparnatural-demo-dbpedia/index.html, and *not* by opening the file directly in your browser (`file://...`), otherwise the loading of component specification fails and your will get a blank page;
3. Look at how the specification files are written under `sparnatural-demo-dbpedia/config/spec-search.json` and `sparnatural-demo-openarchaeo/config/spec-search.json`;

# Features

## Query Structure

### Basic query pattern

Select the type of entity to search...

![](documentation/1-screenshot-class-selection.png)

... then select the type of the related entity.

![](documentation/2-screenshot-object-type-selection.png)

In this case there is only one possible type of relation between the two "_studied by_", so it gets selected automatically. Then select a value for the related entity, in this case in a dropdown list :

Congratulations, your first SPARQL query criteria is complete !

![](documentation/4-screenshot-criteria.png)

Now you can fetch the generated SPARQL query :

### "WHERE"

This enables to navigate the graph :

![](documentation/6-where.png)

### "AND"

Combine criterias :

![](documentation/7-and.png)

### "OR"

Select multiple values for a criteria :

![](documentation/8-or.png)

## Values selection

Sparnatural offers currently 6 ways of selecting a value for a criteria : autocomplete field, dropdown list, simple string value, date range (year or date precision), date range with a search in a period name (e.g. "bronze age"), or no selection at all.

### Autocomplete field

### Dropdown list

### String value (text search)

### Date range (year or date precision)

### Date range with search in period name

### No value selection


## Multilingual

Sparnatural is multilingual and supports displaying labels of classes and properties in multiple languages.


## Limitations

### Only basic graph patterns, no UNION, OPTIONAL, BIND, etc.

Sparnatural produces only basic graph patterns with VALUES. It does not support the creation of UNION, OPTIONAL, SERVICE, BIND, etc...

### SPARQL endpoint needs to be CORS-enabled

To send SPARQL queries to a service that is not hosted on the same domain name as the web page in which Sparnatural is included, the SPARQL endpoint needs to allow [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](https://enable-cors.org/).

# Integration

## Specification of classes and properties

The component is configurable using a JSON(-LD) ontology file. Look at the specification files under the `config` folders of the demos to get an idea. The file contains :

### Class definition

```json
    {
      "@id" : "http://www.openarchaeo.fr/explorateur/onto#Site",
      "@type" : "Class",
      "label": [
        {
          "@value" : "Site",
          "@language" : "en"
        },
        {
          "@value" : "Site",
          "@language" : "fr"
        }
      ],
	  "iconPath":  "assets/icons/noir/site.png",
	  "highlightedIconPath":  "assets/icons/blanc/site.png"
    },
```

### Property definitions with domains and ranges

```json
    {
      "@id" : "http://www.openarchaeo.fr/explorateur/onto#trouve_dans",
      "@type" : [
        "ObjectProperty",
        "AutocompleteProperty"
      ],
      "label": [
        {
          "@value" : "found in",
          "@language" : "en"
        },
        {
          "@value" : "trouv√© dans",
          "@language" : "fr"
        }
      ],
      "domain": "http://www.openarchaeo.fr/explorateur/onto#Mobilier",
      "range": {
        "@type" : "Class",
        "unionOf" : {
          "@list" : [ 
            { "@id" : "http://www.openarchaeo.fr/explorateur/onto#Site"},
            { "@id" : "http://www.openarchaeo.fr/explorateur/onto#US"},
            { "@id" : "http://www.openarchaeo.fr/explorateur/onto#Sepulture"}
          ]
        }
      }
    },
```

### Using font-awesome icons

It is possible to directly use font-awesome icons in place of icons embedded in your application :

```json
"faIcon":  "fas fa-user",
```

## How to integrate Sparnatural in a webpage

Have a look at `index.html` in the demos folder to see how the component is integrated in a webpage.


## Map the query structure to a different graph structure

_to be written_

Do something like this :

```
      var expand = function(sparql, specs) {
        $.each( specs['@graph'], function( key, val ) {
          if ( val['@type'] == 'ObjectProperty' || val['@type'] == 'Class') {
            if ( val['path'] != null) {
                var re = new RegExp("<" + val['@id'] + ">","g");
                sparql = sparql.replace(re, val['path']);
            }
          }
        }) ;
        return sparql ;
      }
```

(this should be included in the code of Sparnatural itself.)
